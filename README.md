# Prerequisite:
I assume you know how to install and setup webdriver, either firefox or chrome. you first need to download webdriver for your os/browser and then place it in a directory
> see: https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/

# Requirements:
webdriver 
selenium 
numpy 
pandas
time
datetime

# Issues that got fixed:
-problem: data was generated as a single list
>soln: reshaped into desired number of row n col

-prob: crypto "Symbol" was omitted in the header so it affected reshaping the array
>soln: discarded the rest of the headers all together (skipping first 5 elements of the single list) then used my own

-prob: "price, 24h%, and vol24h" was merged together thereby affecting the reshaping of the array
>soln: after reshaping the the single data list into a rÃ—c arra.  discarded the last indexes (containing the mearged elements) first, created a new array for the discarded ones separately (splitted), concatenated both array back together horizontally (axis=1)
